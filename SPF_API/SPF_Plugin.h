/**
 * @file SPF_Plugin.h
 * @brief The single, mandatory header file for any SPF plugin.
 *
 * @details This file defines the stable C-style ABI (Application Binary Interface)
 * that all plugins must use to communicate with the SPF core. It ensures
 * that plugins remain compatible even if the core is compiled with a
 * different compiler version.
 *
 * ================================================================================================
 * KEY CONCEPTS
 * ================================================================================================
 * 
 * 1. **Context-Driven**: Most APIs require a handle (e.g., 'SPF_Logger_Handle'). These 
 *    handles are unique to your plugin and should be obtained during 'OnLoad' or 'OnActivated'.
 * 
 * 2. **Lifecycle Aware**: The plugin goes through distinct stages ('OnLoad' -> 'OnActivated'). 
 *    Different services become available at different stages.
 * 
 * 3. **ABI Stability**: Structures like 'SPF_Core_API' are designed to be extendable. 
 *    New pointers are always added to the end to ensure binary compatibility.
 * 
 * ================================================================================================
 * WORKFLOW
 * ================================================================================================
 * 
 * 1. **Declare Manifest**: Export 'SPF_GetManifestAPI' to tell the framework your plugin's name, 
 *    version, and required hooks.
 * 
 * 2. **Implement Exports**: Implement functions defined in 'SPF_Plugin_Exports' and 
 *    export them via 'SPF_GetPlugin'.
 * 
 * 3. **Early Init (OnLoad)**: Initialize loggers, configs, and **CRITICAL**: Create any 
 *    virtual input devices here to ensure the game SDK registers them.
 * 
 * 4. **Late Init (OnActivated)**: Access game telemetry, install hooks, and register UI windows.
 * 
 * ================================================================================================
 * IMPORTANT RULES
 * ================================================================================================
 * 
 * *   **NEVER** change the order of function pointers in the provided API structures.
 * *   **NEVER** delete fields from API structures.
 * *   **ALWAYS** use the provided 'SPF_Formatting_API' for cross-DLL string formatting to avoid crashes.

 * @page PluginLifecycle Plugin Lifecycle & API Availability
 * @brief Explains the stages of plugin initialization and API access.
 *
 * The framework initializes plugins in stages. The API is passed to each
 * lifecycle function, but its services become available progressively.
 * Attempting to use a service before it is available will result in a runtime error.
 *
 * @section InitializationSequence Initialization Sequence:
 * 1.  @ref OnLoad()
 * 2.  @ref OnActivated()
 * 3.  @ref OnRegisterUI()
 *
 * @subsection OnLoadDetails 1. OnLoad()
 * -   **When:** Immediately after the plugin DLL is loaded.
 * -   **API State:** Only CORE services are available in the `load_api` struct:
 *     -   `logger`, `config`, `localization`, `formatting`
 * -   **Purpose:** Essential setup using core services. The plugin should store
 *     any required handles (e.g., from `logger->GetHandle()`) for later use.
 *
 * @subsection OnActivatedDetails 2. OnActivated()
 * -   **When:** After the framework has processed the manifest and activated the plugin.
 * -   **API State:** ALL services in the `core_api` struct are now available.
 * -   **Purpose:** Main initialization. The plugin MUST store the `core_api` pointer.
 *     Registering callbacks for keybinds, hooks, and other interactive services
 *     MUST be done here.
 *
 * @subsection OnRegisterUIDetails 3. OnRegisterUI()
 * -   **When:** When the UI system is ready.
 * -   **API State:** All services are available via the previously stored `core_api` pointer.
 * -   **Purpose:** UI-specific setup.
